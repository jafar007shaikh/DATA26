Amazon sharholders have given amazon a free pass, no need for profits at all. What do you suppose this does to compeditors. How many jobs are lost because of this free pass. Most businesses have to make money to survive, but amazon has investors that don't care about valuation. They enable the destruction of jobs and small business. If Investors demanded profits, the playing field would be more level. Now the government needs to regulate this destructive force and trump will take action to help small business

This one should also make you scratch your head.
Washington, D.C. – A new Department of Defense Inspector General’s report, released last week, has left Americans stunned at the jaw-dropping lack of accountability and oversight. The glaring report revealed the Pentagon couldn’t account for $6.5 trillion dollars worth of Army general fund transactions and data, according to a report by the Fiscal Times.
The Pentagon, which has been notoriously lax in its accounting practices, has never completed an audit, would reveal how the agency has specifically spent the trillions of dollars allocated for wars, equipment, personnel, housing, healthcare and procurements allotted to them by Congress.
Beginning in 1996 all federal agencies were mandated by law to conduct regular financial audits. However, the Pentagon has NEVER complied with that federal law. In 20 years, it has never accounted for the trillions of dollars in taxpayer funds it has spent, in part because “fudging” the numbers has become standard operating procedure at the Department of Defense, as revealed in a 2013 Reuters investigation by Scot Paltrow.
According to the report by the Fiscal Times:

Under Article I Section 8 of the United States Constitution, only Congress can authorise the borrowing of money on the credit of the United States. From the founding of the United States until 1917, Congress directly authorized each individual debt issued. To provide more flexibility to finance the United States' involvement in World War I, Congress modified the method by which it authorized debt in the Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917.[3] Under this Act, Congress established an aggregate limit, or "ceiling," on the total amount of new bonds that could be issued.
The present debt ceiling is an aggregate limit applied to nearly all federal debt, which was substantially established by the Public Debt Acts[4][5] of 1939 and 1941 which have subsequently been amended to change the ceiling amount.
From time to time, political disputes arise when the Treasury advises Congress that the debt ceiling is about to be reached and indicating that a default is imminent. When the debt ceiling is reached, and pending an increase in the limit, Treasury may resort to "extraordinary measures" to buy more time before the ceiling can be raised by Congress. The United States has never reached the point of default where Treasury was incapable of paying U.S. debt obligations, though it has been close on several occasions. The only exception was during the War of 1812 when parts of Washington D.C. including the Treasury were burned.[6]
In 2011, the United States reached a crisis point of near default on public debt. The delay in raising the debt ceiling resulted in the first downgrade in the United States credit rating, a sharp drop in the stock market, and an increase in borrowing costs. Congress raised the debt limit with the Budget Control Act of 2011, which added to the fiscal cliff when the new ceiling was reached on December 31, 2012.
Another debt ceiling crisis arose in early 2013 when the ceiling was reached again, and Treasury adopted extraordinary measures to avoid a default. The 2013 crisis was resolved, for the time being, on February 4, 2013, President Barack Obama signed the No Budget, No Pay Act of 2013 to, besides other things, suspend the debt ceiling until May 19, 2013. After May 19, the debt ceiling was raised to $16.699 trillion, the level of debt incurred during the suspension, and Treasury resumed extraordinary measures.[7] Treasury Secretary Jack Lew notified Congress that these measures would be exhausted by October 17, 2013.[8] On October 7, 2013 Treasury indicated that the debt ceiling and extraordinary measures will be exhausted and that a default will occur on October 17 when interest payments are due.[citation needed]
The debt ceiling would again have been reached on November 3, 2015.[9][10][11] On October 30, 2015 the debt ceiling was again suspended to March 2017. Copy write Wikipedia. The US Constitution Article 1 Section 8 suspended till 2017. Like a Drunk in a Bar getting free drinks till what.......?%$@#*&$#.

Like the planning of 911 this "hide the inflation" game from the feds script has worked well. Notice how every bill, cable, water, electric, sewer, has added huge increases up to 100% to items such as customer charge, service charge, access charge all of which are not included in the tally of the cost of the actual resource which the Fed Monitors. Notice road tolls have doubled. Notice no more Pensions by employer and three times the cost out of workers pockets for Medical Benefits. Notice Gas Prices have dropped 50% per barrel but to make up for that they added huge taxes on each gallon. Notice year 1980 USA Debit 926 Million on 2.6 Trillion GDP, 1990 3.25 Trillion on 5.44 Trillion GDP, 2000 USA Debit 5.64 Trillion on 9.9 Trillion GDP, 2016 19.864 Trillion Debit on 18.7 Trillion GDP. Is it me or does the ratio keep getting worse. Currency and Credit Derivatives and credit swaps of 584 Trillion. 584 Trillion on People buying and Trading risk of Debit ( To me it's more of a new kind of Casino bigger than Vegas.

The good thing is no Credit Debit Cap and you have Acts "that are just that" Bills Passed with no enforcements.The Balanced Budget Act of 1997, (Pub.L. 105–33, 111 Stat. 251, enacted August 5, 1997), was an omnibus legislative package enacted by the United States Congress, using the budget reconciliation process, and designed to balance the federal budget by 2002.

2 weeks ago, when we were trading at $838.00+, I came in here and posted that Amazon would be closing at below $740 in two weeks. The thing that everyone long did wrong here was to not "take a gain". The most important rule of investing/trading is to take a gain. This post is for the young people who are trading and who are new at trading. If you are older, and haven't learned this yet, you probably never will. My suggestion to any and to all traders is to post it in a frame, on your wall, in your office. Where you see it often.
We are going to $250 here but it could take 3-5 years.
The reason is a multiplicity of reasons, really, but the main one is that "market conditions" are changing very fast now.
HAPPY VETERANS DAY TO ALL.
I SERVED IN THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE AND IT WAS A TREMENDOUS HONOR TO SERVE IN THE MILITARY.
We were in a war and worked 7 days a week, 12-14 hours per day, (that's approx. 84+ hours per week), but we were young and we learned a ton about life, and the great pleasure and satisfaction that work brings to an individual.

It will be very interesting for market tomorrow. Dow on Tuesday night went down to 800 points and down 300+ in the morning, reversed to the plus column, since then Trump added about 700 points to push Dow to the new high. i am thinking about how long the honeymoon will last, and i believe the gravity law. i hope your guys should figure it out, but I don't get it at all.The earnings season is almost over, by average it is ok, not outstanding, except FB. But the future has so many asterisks, So, I think it will be a bumpy ride tomorrow.

No group of people has a more negative impact on american workers and small businesses than the investors in Amazon. They have no expectation Amazon will make any sort of margin even though their scale is huge. With no incentives to increase pricing and provide a return to investors, Amazon continues to undercut small business, drive real wages down and drive competition out of the market. If investors demanded earnings out of Amazon, there would be more realistic pricing for small business. How does Amazon affect american workers? I suspect because AMZN is so miss-priced from a traditional valuation perspective it distorts the market.
